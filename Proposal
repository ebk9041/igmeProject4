I plan on making a make your own monster 8-bit game. 
In the first screen, you will be able to drag and drop different pieces of the monster on the body.
On the second page, there will be a radio button quiz to see which pre made monster you get. 
On the third page, there will be a slider to choose how big the monster is. 


I plan on having this replace my project 2 Grade


I’ll be needing to learn to drag and drop, how to use radio buttons, and how to use the sliders. 
I plan on using jQuery to help learn about what I’m looking to accomplish.
